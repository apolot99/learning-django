# this is the introduction chapter

# brevity means exact use of words in writing

# django is a python-based free and open source web framework. (Just like how there is streamlit, so there is also python)

#      CHAPTER 1

#  The command line: two command line shells on windows i.e command shell and power shell. USE POWER SHELL IT IS STRONGER.

#  Most frequently commands used in django development; 
#  cd (change down a directory)
#  cd..(change up a directory)
#  ls (list files in your current directory)
#  pwd (print working directory)
#  mkdir (make directory)
#  touch (create a new file)

# The $ sign is our command line prompt

# Virtual environments are an isolated container containing all the software dependencies of a given project.

# Use a dedicated virtual environment for each new python project. i.e Pipenv

# Pipenv creates a Pipfile containing software dependencies and a Pipfile.loc for ensuring deterministic builds.

# Determinism means that each time and everytime you download the software in a new virtual environment, you will have exactly the same configuration.
